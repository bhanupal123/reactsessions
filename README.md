 Exercise : 
 
 Modify UserForm component to capture all the form fields and store it in the component state.
 Male or Female should be selected when clicked on the appropriate option.
 The captured value must be returned to parent (App.js) on submit clicked.

 Parent must pass the newly created user info submimtted by UserForm and add a new UserBadge component thereby rendering the user badge with the created information.
 Hint: Try playing around the app.js state to store the users created.

 Upon clicking edit icon placed right side below the user icon in the UserBadge component must populate the UserForm with selected badge information.
 Updating the selected infomation and submit must update the badge that is already displayed for the user.
 All the best!!

 Note: All the html and css for the badge is already coded. Clone the repo or download the zip in this branch and run 'npm install' followed by 'npm start' to start the application.
